        <p>
          Experienced IT Professional, with organized, simple and effective problem-solving skills, using ingenuity and creativity to build fluid and functional web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating with a Master's in Computer Science & Computer Applications, I started a career in Information Technology building web applications in a J2EE environment thus gathering a strong experience in the full SDLC of an application. I took a break to take care of my newborn son and family. Recently, out of curiosity, I started watching videos about the changing landscape of web development which piqued my interest further driving me to start carving a new path to pursue my passion in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a serious step in the same direction, I joined the Rutger's Coding Bootcamp to reinvent myself and graduated as a Full Stack Web Developer. As I navigated through the various projects, my approach was to blend my solid understanding of SDLC and provide a quality end product backed with the new technologies, within the tight timelines of the bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the technologies that I learnt and used in my projects are HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Handlebars, React.js etc. 
        </p>

          The below listed job descriptions are some of my previous jobs and my roles and technologies involved.
